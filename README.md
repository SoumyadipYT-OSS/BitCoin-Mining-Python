# Introduction to Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government. It was introduced in 2008 by an anonymous person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not issued or regulated by any central entity. Instead, it relies on a peer-to-peer network to process transactions and maintain the blockchain. This decentralized nature allows Bitcoin to offer several unique advantages:

**1. Transparency:** All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger, making it easy to trace and verify transactions.

**2. Security:** Bitcoin transactions are secured by cryptographic algorithms, making them highly resistant to fraud and hacking.

**3. Limited Supply:** There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins, which helps to prevent inflation and preserve value over time.

**4. Global Accessibility:** Bitcoin can be sent and received anywhere in the world, making it a truly global currency.
